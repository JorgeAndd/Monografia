Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL, are becoming a storage alternative for huge volumes of data in distributed systems. This paper presents characteristics of these databases, in special Cassandra.

In this work, it is proposed the storage of open data from \emph{Bolsa Fam√≠lia} program in a Cassandra NoSQL database, in order to compare it's performance on two, four and six machines and different volumes of data.
